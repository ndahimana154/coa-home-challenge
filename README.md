# COA Take Home Challenge

## Introduction

This repository contains solutions to two JavaScript coding challenges: Array Manipulation and String Transformation. Additionally, it includes a Figma UI implementation task. The folder structure is simple, containing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

## Folder Structure

- **index.html**: Entry point for the Figma UI implementation task.
- **css/styles.css**: CSS styles for the Figma UI and HTML elements.
- **js/scripts.js**: JavaScript file linked to index.html for UI functionality.
- **js/arrayManipulation.js**: JavaScript file containing the solution to the Array Manipulation task.
- **js/stringManipulation.js**: JavaScript file containing the solution to the String Transformation task.

## Running the Challenges

To run the JavaScript challenges, follow these steps:

1. Open the folder in Visual Studio Code.
2. Open the terminal in VS Code.
3. Run the command for the desired JavaScript file:

```bash
node js/arrayManipulation.js
```

or

```bash
node js/stringManipulation.js
```

To run the Figma UI implementation:

1. Simply open `index.html` in a web browser.

## Notes

- Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system to run the JavaScript files.
- For the Figma UI implementation, no additional setup is required, just open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
